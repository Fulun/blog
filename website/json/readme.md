- **JSON**：Java Script Oject Notation  
`XMLHttpRequest` will establish a connection with a URL that we specify.
- **AJAX**: Asynchronous JavaScript And XML  
**Asynchronous** in the context just means in the background or not requiring a page refresh.  
because in recent years JSON has replaced XML as the more popular data format so JSON has become the industry standard data format.

creating an HTML string that used our JSON data was not very enjoyable. Is there a better way of doing that?
Yes. **JavaScript templating solution named Handlebars.js** which makes creating HTML out of JSON data much much simpler
