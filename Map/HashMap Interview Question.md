#### Perfect HashMap Key
- using **immutable, final object** with proper **_equals()_** and **_hashcode()_** implementation would act as perfect Java HashMap keys and **improve the performance of Java HashMap by reducing collision**.
- suggest that [String](http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2011/07/string-vs-stringbuffer-vs-stringbuilder.html) and various wrapper classes e.g. Integer very good keys in Java HashMap.
